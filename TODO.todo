//using Sublime Text 2 plugin "PlainTasks"

/*
	On server change, don't forget to modify:
	upload_max_filesize=10M
	post_max_size=10M
	allow_url_fopen=On //not sure.. was used for downloading some time 
in php.ini
*/

Story:
	→	Add Tortoise SVN ?
	→	Add RequireJS
		→	Add Configuration
		→	Wrap all JS in modules
		→	Re-work the venting
	→	Add MarionetteJS to Backbone
	→	Add HandlebarsJS
		→	Remove existing templating (underscoreJS and loadTemplate() in utils.js) 
		→	Add requirejs config
		→	Re-work the index.html to split into reusable templates
	→	Add a build system
		→	Add SCSS watcher
		→	Add build minimification
	→	Add SCSS
		→	Clean up CSS
		→	Translate CSS in SCSS

BUG:
	→	@critical When uploading biiiiig files, we get a warning in the Network tab instead of our custom error message, and an empty file is added in collection
	→	Resize save icon
	→	When adding file (also when renaming), check for name if contains wrong chars: (;:<>~`¨-=+\/|!@#$%?&*()¤{}[]¬)...
	→	No sound on mp4 videos ? verify with other types
	→	@high (Bug)(CSS) When changing filter, the scrollbar in NavView doesn't show anymore
	→	signup page: background not filled 100%
	→	(Bug) User.status does not always sets to offline when closing browser
		if(status == 'Away') {
			intervalDisconnect = setTimeout(App.disconnect, 2h);
		}
		...clearInterval(intervalDisconnect);

Task:


Improvement:
	→	STOP manually updating the collection/models....it SHOULD updates itself on changes...
	→	Make a json file with the French/English languages translations
	→	Should have only one "main" collection in NavView.js
		(this.collection, not this.files)
	→	Add debug mode for error loging and warnings
		→	Create log file
	→	Add Venting for triggers and listening
	→	Remove jquery global selectors in views... $("#container") ...
	→	Add warn, error icons to bootbox..?
	→	When adding an image while in filter "File", move filter to "Image" and expand folder, highlight yellow image
	→	We might not want to let users <Rename, delete> because of versioning.. (make sure errors will trigger)
		or maybe if someone edit same file, it would throw error in the meantime?
	→	Put border-bottom color on input[type="text"] focused
	→	news feed on the right (maybe like facebook?)
	→	Calendrier
	→	add user control for public (not able to download or search. Just able to view links send)
		//'guest'

	→	(Back-end) add error severity levels (need to show popup or just log)
		→	try and replicate https://github.com/ccoenraets/backbone-cellar (in terms of routing)
	→	(Back-end) email alert if someone posted something (subscribe)
	→	(Back-end) chat (
			replicate: http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-create-a-simple-web-based-chat-application--net-5931
			or: http://fr.openclassrooms.com/informatique/cours/un-chat-en-php-ajax
		)
	→	(Back-end) Authentication: JWT https://github.com/firebase/php-jwt/blob/master/Authentication/JWT.php

Idea:
	→	Fix font size in general
	→	adjust event functions so that we can call them without passing (e) target
	  REMOVE Events handlers and only add selectMenuItem() and call it in router. It will be called when user click on links
	→	RE-FACTOR ConvoView (convo, conversations, etc) to something like InfoView
	→	RE-FACTOR: Split ConvoView to ( previewView, fileCommentsView )
	→	RE-FACTOR: Split NavView to (FilterView, SearchView, NavView)
	→	Replace fadeIn().css("display", "...") to an animate() that toggles opacity (try removing CSS in JS)
	→	Create better namespace on $.Innervate. Wrap each code files with siaf. $ in param will already contains Innervate

	→	Add no internet mode (backbone.localstorage), and server mode (SQL)
		https://github.com/mattzeunert/minmal-Backbone.localStorage-example
		→	Export: localstorage afterwards in json file (localstorage var is in window global, just copy paste in json file when exiting)
		→	Import:
			var data = JSON.parse(previously_exported_string);
			for (var key in data) {
			  localstorage[key] = data[key];
			}
