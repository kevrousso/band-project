Back-end:

- try and replicate https://github.com/ccoenraets/backbone-cellar

- On file create, move uploaded file to associated directory

- email alert if someone posted something
- chat (
	replicate: http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-create-a-simple-web-based-chat-application--net-5931
	or: http://fr.openclassrooms.com/informatique/cours/un-chat-en-php-ajax
	)
- connected users (online/offline property in SQL and in user-model)


##### General ideas ######
- Merge Index.html and Signup.html

- adjust nav Routing to be more like filter routing
- adjust event functions so that we can call them without passing (e) target
    ->>> REMOVE Events handlers and only add selectMenuItem() and call it in router. It will be called when user click on links

- Expand all folders after search, un-expand them on clear search  (showContent() refactor )

- add spinner dynamically when needed, and add fadeIn Out of navContent when item is clicked

- Replace fadeIn().css("display", "...") to an animate() that toggles opacity (try removing CSS in JS)

- Create better namespace on $.Innervate. Wrap each code files with siaf. $ in param will already contains Innervate

BUG:

//weird bug when adding a folder, then adding a file in that folder: file gets a id < folder's id
	// ^still relevent ?
